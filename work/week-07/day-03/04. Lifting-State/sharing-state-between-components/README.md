**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson, students will be able to transfer state from one component to its sibling through their parent's state.

## Setting up state for `App`

This next section aims to set up a state for the `App` component and incorporate the `newTodo` data coming up from the `<NewTodo>` child component. Let's start by initializing state in `App.jsx`. At the top of the file, import `useState`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import { useState } from 'react';
```

Inside the `App` function, initialize a state variable `todo` as an empty array and generate its setter function:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
```

Now comes the exciting part. We want `addTodo` to append its `newTodo` parameter onto the `todos` state array and then log `todos`. You might think you could do something like the following:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  const addTodo = (newTodo) => {
    todos.push(newTodo);
    console.log(todos);
  };
```

***BUT YOU CAN'T!*** One of the rules of React is that you can't mutate a state variable outside of a setter function like `setTodos`. Instead, you have to create a new empty array, fill it up with the current values of `todos`, and then add `newTodo` to the end of it. This way, the original `todos` state variable remains untouched until `setTodos` changes it.

> ♻️ Repeatable pattern: To reiterate, ***you will never update state with the `push()` method in React, ever***.

Let's implement the correct method of setting our `todos` state.

1. So, we start with a brand new empty array inside `addTodo`:

   ```jsx
   // src/App.jsx

     const addTodo = (newTodo) => {
       const updatedTodos = [];
     };
   ```

2. Now alter that statement to use the spread operator `...`, which takes the values of an array and *spreads* or copies them into a new array:

   ```jsx
   // src/App.jsx

     const addTodo = (newTodo) => {
       const updatedTodos = [...todos];
     };
   ```

3. Now, `updatedTodos` is just a duplicate of `todos`. Let's add the `newTodo` as a new item at the end of the array:

   ```jsx
   // src/App.jsx

     const addTodo = (newTodo) => {
       const updatedTodos = [...todos, newTodo];
     };
   ```

4. We can now pass this new array into `setTodos` (adding a console log for testing):

   ```jsx
   // src/App.jsx

     const addTodo = (newTodo) => {
       const updatedTodos = [...todos, newTodo];
       console.log(updatedTodos);
       setTodos(updatedTodos);
     };
   ```

5. Or, more concisely (this code results in the same functionality as above):

   ```jsx
   // src/App.jsx

     const addTodo = (newTodo) => {
       console.log([...todos, newTodo])
       setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
     };
   ```

Nice! Check the browser. Type something into the text input and click the **Create to-do** button. Each time the button is clicked, the DevTools console should log the entire `todos` array with whatever was typed into the text input as its last element.

We've successfully moved data from a child component into the parent's state.

### Displaying the to-dos

Now that we've got the `App` component's `todos` state variable updating properly, all we need to do now is display items on the page. Update the `return` statement in `App.jsx` like so:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  return (
    <>
      <h1>To-do App</h1>
      <NewTodo addTodo={addTodo} />
      <ul>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => {
          return <li key={index}>{todo}</li>;
        })}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
```

Try it out the browser, and you should have a working to-do app! We have successfully lifted the state from the `<NewTodo>` form, used it to update the `<App>` component's state, and displayed the values coming up from `<NewTodo>` in `<App>`.

### Moving the list to its own component

Now that we've passed data from a child component to a parent component through lifting state, let's see how to pass this same data back down to a sibling component. We'll pass the `todos` state variable in `<App>` down into a new child, which we'll call `<TodoList>`. In this way, the data comes up from `<NewTodo>` into `<App>` and then goes back down into `<TodoList>`.

First, let's create a new component to hold our `<TodoList>`:

```bash
touch src/components/TodoList.jsx
```

Add the following to it:

```jsx
// src/components/TodoList.jsx

const TodoList = (props) => {
  const tempTodos = ['first', 'second', 'third'];
  return (
    <ul>
      {tempTodos.map((todo, index) => {
        return <li key={index}>{todo}</li>;
      })}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default TodoList;
```

There's nothing too exciting here. It's currently a standalone component with a static array that gets mapped over to generate `<li>` elements. Import that component into `App.jsx`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

import TodoList from './components/TodoList.jsx';
```

Add it to the `return` statement in `App.jsx` and replace the `<ul>` we created in the last section. The `return` statement in `App.jsx` should now look like this:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  return (
    <>
      <h1>To-do App</h1>
      <NewTodo addTodo={addTodo} />
      <TodoList />
    </>
  );
```

If you check the browser, you should see that a static three-item list has replaced our previous dynamic list. That's fine. We'll make the `<TodoList>` dynamic next.

Pass the `todos` state variable in `App.jsx` into `<TodoList/>`:

```jsx
// src/App.jsx

  return (
    <>
      <h1>To-do App</h1>
      <NewTodo addTodo={addTodo} />
      <TodoList todos={todos}/>
    </>
  );
```

Now, in `TodoList.jsx`, use `props.todos` instead of `tempTodos` (which you can remove now). `Todos.jsx` should now look like this:

```jsx
// src/components/TodoList.jsx

const TodoList = (props) => {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.todos.map((todo, index) => {
        return <li key={index}>{todo}</li>;
      })}
    </ul>
  );
};

export default TodoList;
```

Congrats! You have now lifted state up from `NewTodo.jsx` into `App.jsx` and then passed it back down into `TodoList.jsx`, effectively moving state from `NewTodo.jsx` to its sibling component `TodoList.jsx`.
