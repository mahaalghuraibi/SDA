**Learning Objective:** Understand how to use **Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)** to encapsulate variables and prevent them from entering the global scope.

One of the ways we can prevent our code from leaking into the global scope is by wrapping it with a construct known as an Immediately Invoked Function Expression, or IIFE (pronounced iffy). It looks like this:

```javascript
(() => {
  'use strict';

  // your code here
	
})()
```

Wrapping the function in parenthesis (this is a [grouping operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Grouping) that acts as a container for the function) and invoking it means that it is executed right when it's defined.
